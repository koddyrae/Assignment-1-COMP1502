# Bryce's contributions

# Koddy's contributions
My main contributions started with working on the methods that deal with the file found in the record class. As I finished the initial version of those methods, I shifted my focus towards the AppMenus and documentation for the project. Documentation included adding comments and documentation headers to all the methods in the projects, and then I worked on testing for the project.

# General summary of work distribution
We each worked on different parts of the project at the beginning, but as the project matured we each modified each other's code as needed, wrote code for each other, and by the end of the project we each understood each other's code and weren't very concerned with who had written what because we knew it all. Wow, that was a long sentence.
