# General summary of work distribution
We each worked on different parts of the project at the beginning, but as the project matured we each modified each other's code as needed, wrote code for each other, and by the end of the project we each understood each other's code and weren't very concerned with who had written what because we knew it all. Wow, that was a long sentence.
